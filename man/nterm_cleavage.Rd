\usage{
nterm_cleavage(...)
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
  - `peptide`: the input peptide sequence
  - `nterm`: the N-terminal cleavage sequence (n residues on each side)
  - `nterm_cleavage_pos`: the position of the N-terminal cleavage in the library sequence
}
\description{
Wrapper for `cleavage()` that extracts the N-terminal cleavage sequence
and cleavage position from a peptide relative to its library sequence.

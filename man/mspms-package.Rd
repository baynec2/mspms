This package provides functions for the analysis of data generated by the multiplex substrate profiling by mass spectrometry for proteases (MSP-MS) method. Data exported from upstream proteomics software is accepted as input and subsequently normalized, outlier removed, and imputed. Tools for statistical analysis, visualization, and interpretation of the data are provided.

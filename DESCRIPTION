Description: This package provides functions for the analysis of data generated 
    by the multiplex substrate profiling by mass spectrometry for proteases 
    (MSP-MS) method. Data exported from upstream proteomics software is accepted 
    as input and subsequently processed for analysis. 
    Tools for statistical analysis, visualization, and interpretation of 
    the data are provided.

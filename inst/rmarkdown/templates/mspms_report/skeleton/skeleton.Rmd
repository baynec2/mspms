# Info

This report has been automatically generated by the mspms package. It contains standard results of the mspms analysis pipeline. 


R session info is as follows:  

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
# Data Processing 

```{r}
# The standard mspms data processing pipeline is used here. 
mspms = mspms::mspms(prepared_data,design_matrix)
```


# Overview 
```{r}
mspms::plot_pca(mspms)
```

**Figure 1.** Here a PCA of the experiment is displayed. The color represents time, while shape and linetype of eclipse (if there are enough points to calculate) represents condition. 


```{r}
mspms::plot_heatmap(mspms)
```

**Figure 2.** Here an interactive heatmap of the experiment is displayed. Mouse over to see more information on each cell. Column side colors represent condition and time. 

# Statistics 

```{r}
t1 = mspms::mspms_anova(mspms) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(p.adj)

DT::datatable(t1)
```

**Table 1. ** Here anova results are displayed for each condition (testing to see if there is an effect on time). 


```{r}
t2 = log2fc_t_test(mspms) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(p.adj)

DT::datatable(t2)
```

**Table 2.** Here T-test results are displayed as compared to time 0 for each condition


```{r}
plot_volcano(t2)
```

**Figure 3.** Here the Log2fc and T tests are displayed as volcano plots relative to T0 for each condition. 

# Cleavage Motifs

```{r}
print(mspms::plot_all_icelogos(mspms))
```



**Figure 4.** Here the cleavage motifs enriched in each condition are shown.
